<div class="bk1"><p><i><big>It was, Kirk thought, like standing in a gully, watching
a boulder teeter precariously above you. It might

its weight. Your only possible defenses are your
brain and voice&mdash;but how do you argue with a boulder

<div class="bk2"><h1>'mid pleasures and palaces</h1>

<h2>By James McKimmey, Jr.</h2>

<p><b>Illustrated by Philip Parsons</b></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">This planet</span> was remote and
set apart, and nothing about
it had made William Kirk think he
might find human life. Yet just beyond,
through a thorny bush shaped
like an exploding rose, Kirk had
seen eyes and nose and a flash of
yellow hair that were definitely human.</p>

<p>Kirk poised motionless. He was
three miles from the rocket and
Leo, who was waiting inside of it.
He thought for a moment of how
Leo had told him, as they made
their landing, that this is the kind of
planet where you could go no further.
This is the kind of planet that
could be the end of twelve years,
and you'd better be careful, William,
old sport.</p>

<p>Kirk noticed a faint breeze; his
palms were wet, and they cooled
when the breeze touched them. He
placed his palms against his jacket.
Damn you, Leo, he thought. Damn
your rotten fortune-telling. Kirk
was superstitious when he was in
space, and the memory of Leo Mason's
cool, quiet voice saying
"Watch it now, sport. Be careful, be
careful ..." seemed now like some
certain kiss of fate.</p>

<p>The bush trembled and Kirk's
right hand flicked to his holster. His
pistol was cold against his fingers
and he let it fit loosely in his hand,
the barrel half-raised.</p>

<p>The bush shivered again, and
then all at once the figure was rising
from behind it, a tall wide figure
with a very tan face, lined and
toughened by the sun. The shoulders,
bare like the chest, were massive,
yet somehow stretched-looking,
as though endless exposure to wind
and rain and sun had turned the
skin to brown leather.</p>

<div class="figr"><img src="images/001.png" width="364" height="550" alt="" title="" /></div>

<p>Kirk had his pistol pointing at
the figure's stomach now, and the
figure blinked, while the breeze
touched and ruffled the long
bleached hair.</p>

<p>The figure raised a large hand,
palm up, and curled the fingers.
"Hello?" he said softly. Kirk was
surprised by the word and the polite
sound of it.</p>

<p>Kirk remained motionless, pistol
pointing. "Who are you?" he said
through his teeth.</p>

<p>"Harry," said the figure, as
though Kirk surely should know
who he was. "I'm Harry, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Kirk carefully.
"Harry?"</p>

<p>The figure nodded. "Harry Loren,
don't you know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Kirk said, his eyes
watchful. "Harry Loren." There
was something about the man's
eyes, Kirk decided. They were deep
set and very bright within their
sockets. They didn't match the softness
of the speech. Harry Loren
smiled and showed his yellow teeth.
"Who are you?" he asked politely.</p>

<p>"I'm William," Kirk said. It was
as though he might be speaking to
a frightened child, he thought, who
held a sharp knife in his hands.
"William Kirk, of course."</p>

<p>Harry Loren nodded apologetically.
"Oh, yes. I can't remember
everyone. It's been so long. How are
you, William?"</p>

<p>Kirk's eyes flickered. "I'm fine."</p>

<p>"That's nice," Harry Loren
nodded. His wild hair brushed over
his shoulders and reflected its yellowness
against the sun. The knife
then, the one that Kirk had thought
about a moment ago, appeared in
the figure's hand. "<i>Bastard</i>," Harry
Loren hissed, and he was leaping at
Kirk, the knife making a sweep toward
Kirk's stomach.</p>

<p>Something kept Kirk from
squeezing the trigger, and instead
he swung his pistol so that it struck
the brown, weathered knuckles.
The knife flew into a thicket and
Loren, screaming, was upon Kirk,
reaching for Kirk's neck. Kirk
wrenched backward and at the
same time swung the barrel of the
pistol toward the yellow flying hair.
There was a cracking sound, and
Harry Loren, brown and wild-looking,
crumpled silently before Kirk's
feet.</p>

<p>Kirk examined the man, then he
reached down and picked up the
knife from the thicket. It was crudely
hammered out from some kind of
alloy, but sharp nevertheless, and
it could have been deadly in a hand
like Harry Loren's.</p>

<p>Kirk looked again at the yellow-haired
man on the ground. He was
wearing some kind of ragged cloth
about his waist and nothing else.
Across his back, Kirk could see, was
a curving scar, an inch wide and
ten or twelve inches long. It was
white and very noticeable against
the brown of the man's skin.</p>

<p>Kirk bent down, looking at the
scar carefully. It could have been
made during a crash of a rocket,
but there were, he noticed, fine
whiter ridges running along the
length of the scar as though they
had been made by fine comb-like
teeth. A talon, perhaps. Some kind
of strange claw. Kirk straightened
quickly.</p>

<p>It went through his head that
Harry Loren might not be the only
animal life on this planet. He tightened
his hand on his pistol, stepping
backward, his eyes darting.</p>

<p>But he could only pivot slowly,
trying to see, to discover, and he
was much too slow when he finally
saw it. It was only a flash of yellow
and brown, making a hissing kind
of sound. He felt the ripping along
his right arm. The pistol was going
out of his hand. And a swirling
blackness got in front of his eyes.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">When he awoke</span> he saw
Harry Loren first, who was
sitting up now, silent, motionless,
with Kirk's pistol resting in his
hands.</p>

<p>To the side of Loren and just a
little behind rested a peculiar-looking
thing. It was alive because its
head, shaped like a cone that had
been attached to its neck, kept
swaying gently back and forth. The
dark blue eyes, spaced back from
the smallest end of the cone, were
rather small with no lids. The creature's
neck was long and thin, a
multitude of shades of yellow and
brown like the head, and the rest
of the body widened out like a funnel
and this area was covered with
yellow feathers. It had what appeared
to be arms and legs, long
thin extensions of dark brown with
large bony joints. At the end of each
of these, Kirk could see a flat claw
with rows of tiny comb-like teeth.</p>

<p>Loren reached out and ran a
hand softly along the creature's long
neck.</p>

<p>Kirk tried to think, testing his
muscles without moving, and he remembered
then the ripping along
his right arm. He looked at the arm
and at the way his jacket had been
torn away along with the shirt beneath
it. He could see the comb-like
marking of his skin. The cut was
not deep but it bled a little and
stung. He tried to move his arm and
found that he could.</p>

<p>Kirk looked back to Loren. Loren
stroked his hand along the thin
neck of the creature. Kirk decided
to try:</p>

<p>"That's a nice-looking animal,
Harry."</p>

<p>Loren's expression did not
change.</p>

<p>Kirk paused. From the looks of
the man, Loren had been here a
long time, a very long time. It had
been a crash, probably. And all the
years afterward of loneliness, all the
time for the quiet but sure warping
of the brain.</p>

<p>He raised a hand quickly, watching
Loren's eyes. Loren did not
change expressions or move the pistol,
but Kirk felt a comb-like claw
touching his hand, freezing it to
motionless with its razor tips. Kirk
looked at the creature. The dark
blue eyes were steady. Kirk lowered
his hand slowly and the claw was
drawn away. The creature's head
resumed it's gentle swaying, and
Loren's hand resumed its stroking.</p>

<p>Kirk licked his lips.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" Loren
said, his voice sudden and hoarse
now.</p>

<p>"Where have I been?" Kirk said,
tight and motionless.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come before?"</p>

<p>Kirk considered it. The dancing
lights in the man's eyes, the high-strung
sound of his voice were
things to make you wary and careful.
Kirk closed his fingers the
slightest bit. "I didn't know you
were here."</p>

<p>Loren's lips thinned. "Liar."</p>

<p>Kirk thought he might try a
smile, to reassure Loren that he
was telling the truth. He decided
against it. "How long have you been
here, Harry?"</p>

<p>"How would I know?"</p>

<p>Kirk thought of the endless nights
and days when time ran together
and there was no more separation
of one time from another. Today
would be tomorrow and tomorrow
would be today. No changes. Endless.
"Did you crash, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Did you crash, Harry?" Loren
mimicked, and for a moment Kirk
felt a chill dancing through him as
he watched the sarcastic leer of
Loren's mouth.</p>

<p>Kirk kept his tone polite, patronizing.
"Was there anyone else?"</p>

<p>Loren laughed, a laugh that
bounced over the rocks and through
the scrubs and bushes.</p>

<p>"Was there, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Loren said, grinning
and showing his yellow teeth. "Six.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Would you like to see their graves?
I've kept the graves pretty. I know
where they are because I dug
them."</p>

<p>Loren remained in a half crouch,
the fingers of one hand holding the
pistol loosely, the other keeping up
its monotonous stroking of the animal.
His eyes seemed to become vacant
for a moment, as though lost
in the memory of the digging of six
graves. Then they narrowed.
"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>Kirk tried to match his answer
to the wants of the man. "I came
as soon as I could."</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Kirk said. "I did."</p>

<p>Loren's right hand stopped its
stroking and his fingers tightened
about the thin long neck of the animal.
"Eddie?" he said.</p>

<p>Kirk saw the animal's left claw
whipping out. He ducked suddenly,
but the claw ripped along his left
arm. He tried to roll sideways, and
then he lay, half sprawled, looking
at the blood welling up from this
new set of ripped ridges in his arm.
He shifted his eyes to look at the
animal, and he was quite certain
that he could detect a small mouth
fitting around the under side of the
funnel-shaped head. It was only a
line, but Kirk thought that there
was a grinning look to it.</p>

<p>"You didn't come as soon as you
could," Loren said, his voice an
angry trembling sound.</p>

<p>"I did, Harry," Kirk said, still remaining
in his half sprawl. "I really
did."</p>

<p>Loren replaced his hand on the
neck of the animal, squeezing.</p>

<p>"No, no," Kirk said, and he tried
to keep the panic out of his voice.
"Harry, I'm telling you the truth!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Loren's mouth</span> showed a
faint surface of his yellow teeth.
He shook his head, slowly, back and
forth, his fingers tightening about
the animal's neck.</p>

<p>"Harry, listen," Kirk said, watching
Loren's squeezing fingers, "it's
over now. You don't have to wait
any longer. I'll take you back now.
I'll take you home!"</p>

<p>Loren froze, staring. "Home?" he
said.</p>

<p>"That's right," Kirk said. "That's
right, Harry."</p>

<p>"<i>Home</i>," Loren breathed, and
his eyes were suddenly like a child's,
wide and unbelieving.</p>

<p>"The waiting's all over," Kirk
said. "You don't have to wait any
longer."</p>

<p>"I don't have to wait any longer,"
Loren repeated softly, and his hand
dropped from the neck of the animal.</p>

<p>Kirk watched Loren and the
swaying animal. "The rocket's
ready," he said.</p>

<p>Loren's eyes were lost in some
distant memory. Gradually Kirk
could see the eyes turn shiny with
tears. "Is Annette waiting?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Kirk thought quickly. He knew
that what he was going to say
shouldn't be said, because he had
no right. But he was thinking of
his own skin. "Why, yes, Harry," he
said slowly. "I imagine Annette <i>is</i>
waiting."</p>

<p>Loren let a quick breath come
through his teeth. "Annette," he
whispered. "And Dickie?"</p>

<p>"Dickie?" Kirk said.</p>

<p>"Little Dickie?" Loren said and
he held his breath.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," Kirk lied. "Of
course."</p>

<p>"I can't ask about Eddie, because
we never had the chance," Loren
said, his eyes still lost. "I always
told Annette that no kid should
ever grow up without a brother,
only we never had the chance for
Eddie." Loren reached out absently
and touched the brown and yellow
neck of the creature. "I called this
fellow Eddie, though. Do you suppose
that was all right? He's not
very pretty."</p>

<p>Kirk nodded, looking at the waving,
funnel-shaped head of the animal.
"That was all right, Harry."</p>

<p>"Does she still braid her hair?"
Loren asked, his eyes shiny.</p>

<p>"What?" Kirk said.</p>

<p>"Annette. Does she still braid her
hair?"</p>

<p>"Why," Kirk said slowly, feeling
his palms going moist. "Why
wouldn't she, Harry?"</p>

<p>A faint smile flickered across
Loren's lips as he remembered.</p>

<p>Kirk watched one of the creature's
claws, out of the corners of
his eyes. He opened and closed the
fingers of one hand, testing. The
claw jerked slightly.</p>

<p>The blood of Kirk's new wound
was drying, he knew, because it had
been only a surface cut. He wondered
how it would be if the thing
used its claws with serious intent.
Like it must have to make the cut
that had been raked into Loren's
back. Loren was bending forward
now, and Kirk could see the tip end
of that scar. Somehow Loren had
managed to stay alive and befriend
the creature. Eddie. The lidless eyes
stared.</p>

<p>Kirk knew that he had to make
use of the moment. It could break
apart any time, the wildness could
return, the unreasoning....</p>

<p>"Listen, Harry," he said, "we
ought to get started, you know.
There's no use waiting longer."</p>

<p>"Started?" Loren said.</p>

<p>"Of course," Kirk said, trying to
keep his voice matter-of-fact.
"You're going home."</p>

<p>Loren looked at Kirk and his eyes
turned suddenly hard and his
mouth lost the faint smile. "I am,"
he stated flatly.</p>

<p>"Yes," Kirk said. "Of course."</p>

<p>"You're a liar."</p>

<p>"Now, Harry," Kirk said, his eyes
flickering to the waiting animal. "I
surely wouldn't lie to you."</p>

<p>"You haven't come for me until
after all this time, and now you say
you surely wouldn't lie to me."</p>

<p>It was like standing in a gully,
Kirk thought, watching a boulder
teetering above you. It tipped this
way and that, and you didn't know
when or if it was going to come
hurtling down. You waited. But
Kirk couldn't wait, he knew. He
had to do something.</p>

<p>"Harry, listen. It wasn't easy to
find you, don't you see?" He hoped
he was making it sound as though
all he had done for the last dozen
years of exploring was look for
Harry Loren. He wished that the
damned thing would stop swaying
its ugly head back and forth. Loren's
hand was inching out toward
the yellow and brown neck.</p>

<p>"Look, Harry, these things aren't
done in a day. We&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A day!" Loren hissed. "A <i>day</i>!
All this time and you say a <i>day</i>!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm sorry," Kirk said quickly.
He wished he could shift out
of the cramped half-lying position
he was in. "I didn't mean a day,
Harry. I meant it wasn't easy. We
didn't know where you were&mdash;" He
was talking quickly, whining almost,
and he'd never whined before.</p>

<p>Loren's fingers were touching the
waving neck.</p>

<p>"We'd better hurry," Kirk said
desperately. "Annette's waiting.
And Dickie, of course."</p>

<p>Loren blinked.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to keep
them waiting any longer, not after
all this time, Harry."</p>

<p>Loren stroked his fingers slowly
down the long neck of the animal.</p>

<p>"I think," Kirk said, almost
hoarsely, "now that I really remember
it, Annette <i>was</i> still wearing her
hair braided. I remember that now,
Harry. Positively."</p>

<p>Loren froze the motion of his
hand and stared at Kirk. His lips
trembled, and then suddenly he put
his hands in front of his face. He
bent forward, and Kirk felt his
nerves jumping, watching the man
start to cry.</p>

<p>The animal turned its stare away
from Kirk for the first time. It
looked at Loren and then slowly
raised a claw, touching Loren's
shoulder carefully. It made a sound
then, a peculiar hissing sound, soft,
barely audible. There was no danger
in it, or menace, only a pitiful
sound.</p>

<p>Loren raised his head a little and
brought his hands away from his
face. Tears had cut through dust
and grime and his face was
streaked.</p>

<p>"Shall we go, Harry?" Kirk said.</p>

<p>Loren wiped at his eyes, stupidly,
without knowing what he was doing.
Then he brought his hands
down and wiped them across his
chest.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "Let's go."
He picked up Kirk's pistol from
where he had dropped it on the
ground and held it out.</p>

<p>Kirk looked at the gun and at the
animal. The claw had been drawn
away from Loren's shoulder and
again it was poised, ready. "You
keep it, Harry," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Of course," Loren said.
There was a moment of silence as
Loren stuck the pistol absently into
the waist of his ragged cloth covering,
beside the knife. The three of
them waited then, Kirk, Loren, and
the animal.</p>

<p>"Eddie?" Loren said finally. "Are
you ready?"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Kirk felt</span> himself smiling in
the direction of the animal. He
remembered when he was a small
boy, going by a house where there
had been a mongrel with a flat head
and large teeth. He had smiled at
that animal as he was doing now.
The dog had sensed his fear in spite
of the smile.</p>

<p>Loren was standing up slowly,
and the animal's head swayed in
slow circling motions.</p>

<p>"All right?" Loren said.</p>

<p>Kirk glanced at the man, saw the
wild, nearly vacant look of the face,
the polite tilt of the head. Kirk's
palms were wet. Goddamn it, he
thought, and he stood up suddenly.</p>

<p>The animal extended a claw,
slowly, turning it so that it seemed
to wind and circle as it came toward
Kirk.</p>

<p>"<i>Eddie</i>," Loren said.</p>

<p>The claw came away. Kirk
caught his breath.</p>

<p>"Shall we go?" Loren said, his
eyes shining.</p>

<p>"Yes," Kirk said. "We'll go,
Harry." He turned slowly, so that
his back was to Loren and the animal.
He thought about the comb-like
claws and the scar on Loren's
back. He thought about Loren's
knife and about the pistol.</p>

<p>He wanted to look back as he
walked. He wanted to talk, to hear
Loren's answer and so know just
where he was. More than anything
he wanted to break into a run and
get into that rocket and get out of
here.</p>

<p>He could see the gleam of the
rocket finally, but he didn't look
back yet. He kept moving. As he
got closer he could see Leo, standing
near the base of the ship, tall,
leaning carelessly against the silver
surface, smoking. He wanted to
shout to Leo, to tell him for God's
sake to wake up and protect him.</p>

<p>They reached the edge of the
clearing and Leo, whose careless
body had stiffened, waited motionless,
one hand on his pistol. Kirk
stopped. "There it is, Harry," he
said, not turning around. "There's
the ship." He waited, half-closing
his eyes, breathing slowly.</p>

<p>There was no sound.</p>

<p>"That's Leo, my friend, Harry,"
Kirk said, putting his palms flat
against his thighs. "Your friend,
Harry."</p>

<p>Leo, Kirk could see, was still
frozen, his eyes slitted to narrow
brightness. Kirk began to step into
the clearing. "Hello, there, Leo," he
said, his voice a tense, grating
sound. "I've brought some friends."</p>

<p>Leo was lifting his pistol out of
its holster, inchingly.</p>

<p>"<i>Friends</i>," Kirk rasped.</p>

<p>Leo's thin eyes flickered and the
pistol slid back into the holster.</p>

<p>Kirk turned around slowly, and
he saw that Loren had stopped just
inside the clearing. The animal remained
beside him, its head making
its slow circles. Loren was staring
up at the rocket and the sun reflecting
from the bright surface, came
down and shown on Loren's face,
deepening the lines there.</p>

<p>"Leo," Kirk said slowly, "this is
Harry Loren and his friend, Eddie.
Harry's been here quite a while,
waiting for us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes?" said Leo, still not
moving.</p>

<p>"That's right, Leo," Kirk said.
"Quite a while. What year was it,
Harry?" he said across the clearing.
"What year did you crash?"</p>

<p>Loren blinked and there were
tears again in his eyes. He reached
out slowly, and the animal shifted
so that its head touched Loren's
hand. "Twenty-four-nineteen."</p>

<p>Kirk put his teeth together.
"Twenty-four-nineteen," he said.</p>

<p>Loren nodded slowly, his eyes
still upon the rocket.</p>

<p>"Eighteen years," Leo said softly.</p>

<p>"A long time, Leo," Kirk said.
He thought of a girl with her hair
braided about her head, looking up,
while Loren had shot into the
depths of sky and space. He thought
of a little boy called Dickie, standing
there, too, watching a fast-disappearing
blackness in the sky. He
thought about eighteen years, and
the fading of youth. A boy becoming
a man. Braided hair becoming
gray. Memories fading and minds
adjusting. New love, new dedication.
A world shifting, a universe
shifting.</p>

<p>Kirk looked at Eddie, the animal,
real and alive, waiting patiently at
the tips of Loren's fingers. "Eddie's
been with Harry for a long time,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh?" said Leo quietly.</p>

<p>Loren's hand stroked the brown
and yellow head.</p>

<p>"Harry," Kirk said. "We're going
to leave now. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Loren was silent.</p>

<p>"You go up first, will you, Leo?"
Kirk said.</p>

<p>Leo looked at him, a faint frown
touching his brow, then he began
moving up the ladder to the air
lock. Kirk waited until Leo had disappeared
into the rocket, then he
repeated, "We're going to leave
now, Harry. Are you ready?"</p>

<p>Loren remained motionless, his
hand touching the animal's head.
Suddenly he turned then and began
moving slowly away through the
brush, the brown and yellow creature
bobbing beside him with queer
rocker-like jumps.</p>

<p>"Goodby, Harry," Kirk said.
Finally he turned and climbed up
the ladder. When he had gotten
into his seat, he said, "Let's go,
Leo," and he moved his hands to
the controls.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The rocket</span> settled into the quiet
motion of its course through space.</p>

<p>"But I don't get it," Leo said. "I
really don't. All that time, and then
all he has to do is walk a dozen
yards and get into the rocket and
he's going home. That's all he
would have to do."</p>

<p>"Why?" Kirk said.</p>

<p>"Why?" said Leo, frowning.</p>

<p>Kirk nodded, looking at the man.
"Why?"</p>
